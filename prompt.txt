report_overview.pdf and 
README.md file completely an build the listed service emulators only and integrate the AI features which was listed here only

DETAILS:

OVERVIEW 
An AI based adaptive medium level interaction-based honeypot mechanism 
system which emulates the following services (ftp, ssh, smb, rdp, MySQL) to 
engage, deceive, and analyse cyber attacker’s behaviours, their commands and 
method of attacks with extensive integration of AI/ML features. 
 
SERVICE EMULATIONS 
1.  SSH:22 
2.  FTP:20 
3.  SMB:445 
4.  RDP:3389 
5.  MYSQL:3306 
NOTE -: the reason behind choosing these services because, these services are most frequently 
attacked and are often choose as prime targets in the current scenario. 
 
PRIMARY FEATURES 
1.  Service Emulation (ftp, ssh, smb, rdp, mysql) 
2.  Virtual Machine or containerization 
3.  AI features (dynamic responses, logging summery, attacks type detection 
forensic chain of custody generation) 
4.  Adaptive banner & response generation 
5.  Logging & forensic chain analysis emulator 
6.  Repayable logging functionality 
7.  Report generation 
CORE-COMPONENTS 
• AI-ENGINE 
• SERVICE EMULATORS 
• LOGGER 
• CONTAINER 
• VIRTUAL MACHINE 
• VISUALIZATION & ANALYSYS 
PRIMARY WORKING FLOW PROCESS 
1.  Spawn docker container and service emulator initialization 
2.  Create thread for each service emulators and listen on the redirection 
ports 
3.  if connection arrives, perform port redirection from the original service 
port to honeypot service port 
4.  dynamic banner generation and displaying to the intruder for specific 
service establishment 
5.  replay of fake response through dynamic content generation with help of 
AI engine models as well as pre-configured filesystem and other 
configurations. 
6.  Generate attackers command response through LLMs with correct 
context and realistic time delay, system load indicators and environ 
establishment. 
7.  Real time behavioural analysis and dynamic environ modification. 
8.  Generate multi-layer logging streams and store every different logging 
format in a secure virtual environment. 
9.  Generate repayable logging and forensic chain of attacks and store in 
their corresponding formats. 
10.  Creating summery of the entire logging simulation and produce 
visualization. 
11.  Close the connection by responding the corresponding service 
connection closing statement. 
 
USPs 
1.  Dynamic policy & response changes without human intervention 
through it. 
2.  Forensic chain of attack visualization of all the attacker’s behaviour and 
command injection to the specific service. 
 
AI ACTIONS & FEATURES 
1.  Can generate dynamic real-time responses on according to commands. 
2.  Analysis of log files, credentials, command, to provide summery. 
3.  Can provide prevention techniques through attack types analysis. 
4.  Generate comprehensive reports. 
5.  Create forensic chain of attack visualization formats from attacker 
behaviour and command executions. 
 
RECOMMENDED TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE 
Primary programming language: python 
Service emulations references 
• ssh (cowrie/qeeqbox/datatrap) 
• ftp (qeeqbox/honeypot-ftp) 
• smb (dionaea/qeeqbox) 
• rdp (rdpy/qeebox) 
• mysql (qeeqbox/datatrap) 
 
ML libraries 
• scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyCaret for fast anomaly detection, clustering, and 
ensemble models. 
• PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning (for LLMs, CNN/LSTMs, or 
custom reinforcement learning logic). 
• SentenceTransformers or spaCy for embedding and NLU tasks (useful for 
“cure the attacker” dynamics and realistic responses). 
LLMs for Emulated Interaction 
1.  Llama3 8B: Strong balance of speed/quality for on-device response 
modeling in Linux shell/service mimicry. 
2.  For generative backends, Ollama, vLLM. 
Adaptive logic and dynamic policy changes 
1.  FastAPI or Flask  
2.  Celery/RQ for queued tasks 
Logging, Forensics, Reporting 
1.  Elastic search 
2.  PostgreSQL 
3.  Json 
4.  Web based interface (optional) 
Visualization 
1.  Grafana 
2.  Kibana 
Containerization 
1.  Docker/docker-compose (containered application for both windows and 
linux) 
2.  Kvm (vm specifically for linux aarch..) 
3.  Qemu (vm for linux aarch..) 
UI/UX 
Current interface: CLI (Command Line interface) 
Future integration: GUI (graphical interface)
NOTE: while building the above listed service emulators and AI features
don't create any unnecessary files and folders if not required create which was necessary and keep professional naming convention and wording to functions, classes and other things and don't train and build the AI model responses and other substitutes from scratch i want you to refer from the
report_overview.pdf so that no mistake should have been done.
